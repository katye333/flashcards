# **Flashcards**

---
Flashcards is a native application that allows the user to create multiple decks of cards with a question and answer. The user can quiz themselves on the deck and receive a grade on the outcome.
This project is part of the ReactJS nanodegree offered by Udacity.

This application was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app).
You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app/blob/master/README.md).
